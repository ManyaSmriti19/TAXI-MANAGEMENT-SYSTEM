# TAXI-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
The main aim of Taxi Management Mini DBMS project is to rent taxi and get payments from respective clients. We aim to demonstrate the use of create, read, update and delete MySQL operations through this project. The project starts by adding a taxi and by adding details of driver using the taxi added. The owner provides taxi to the drivers and ads their expenses on daily basis. Booking scene is where a customers can book a taxi to get o the desired location.
